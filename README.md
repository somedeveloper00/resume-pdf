# Resume PDF

This repository contains my professional resume in PDF format, hosted on GitHub for easy and reliable sharing.

## Why GitHub for Resume Hosting?

I created this GitHub repository as a centralized, permanent location for my resume for several key reasons:

### 📎 **Simple, Direct Link**
Instead of dealing with:
- Email attachments that get lost in inboxes
- Outdated versions floating around
- Large file sizes clogging up emails
- Broken links from temporary file-sharing services

I can share a single, permanent GitHub link that always points to the latest version of my resume.

### 🔗 **Advantages Over Other Platforms**

**vs. LinkedIn:**
- Direct PDF download without requiring account login
- Full control over formatting and presentation
- Easily shareable in any context (applications, messages, forums)

**vs. Google Drive/Dropbox:**
- No account required to view
- No privacy concerns about tracking viewers
- No download limits or access restrictions
- Version control built-in through Git

**vs. Email Attachments:**
- Always the latest version
- No file size concerns
- One link instead of repeated attachments
- Recipients can access anytime

**vs. Personal Website:**
- No hosting costs
- Built-in CDN for fast global access
- 99.9% uptime guaranteed by GitHub
- Simple maintenance

### 🚀 **Easy to Share**
Just copy and paste this link anywhere:
```
https://github.com/somedeveloper00/resume-pdf
```

Or link directly to the PDF file once uploaded (raw GitHub URL for direct downloads).

### 📋 **Version Control**
Every update to my resume is tracked with Git, providing a complete history of changes and the ability to reference specific versions if needed.
